        <h2>A Love Letter for You</h2>
        <p>Heyyy babeee,</p>
        <p>You can't imagine how happy I am to be celebrating this day with you fr. You mean the world to me. I keep telling you that I'm very lucky to have you in my life and I hope you know just how much I mean it evertime I say it. I love you so much bae and I hope you know that I'd do anything within my power to make you happy. Even if its not within my power it'll definitely be within the power of God😂. Unfortunately we probably won't even be spending today together...just like new years💔 but I want you to know that we don't always have to be together to make memories and special moments❤️. Being able to text you everyday and listen to you talk about your day and your tea is more than enough bae😂❤️. I want you to enjoy your day bae... Unfortunately some of your gifts were brought to me so I guess I'll be till the next time we see. My beautiful Gardenia. Thank you for being my constant source of happiness and strength. I love You. Happy Valentines Day Mama❤️</Var>..</p>
        <p>Love, BadmanAg</p>
